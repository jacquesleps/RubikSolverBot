## Overview 
This project implements the two-phase-algorithm to solve Rubik's cube in Python. 
It solve random cubes in less than 20 moves on average within a few seconds.

## Usage
There are several tables which must be created on the first run. 
These need about 80 MB disk space and it takes from about 1/2 to 6 hours to create them, depending on the hardware.
They are already in  this github folder
